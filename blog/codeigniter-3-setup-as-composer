-->
## Motivation
This is the 2nd part of the series __Codeigniter 3 Upgrades__ , this time add the codeigniter 3 as composer with base automation test using PHPUnit

## Problem Context
Codeigniter is not well integrated in composer nor the automation test they there own manual testing library from the codeigniter 3 environments  <a href="https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/libraries/unit_testing.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">class</a>.


## Pathfinding Solution
This is where opensource community comes to play, shout out to <a href="https://github.com/kenjis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenji</a> on making the codiegniter 3 install via <a href="https://github.com/kenjis/codeigniter-composer-installer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">composer</a> and codeigniter 3 phpunit <a href="https://github.com/kenjis/ci-phpunit-test" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">structure</a>

First lets update our dockerfile to support composer image as multi stage build
