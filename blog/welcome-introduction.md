This is my first post here in the internet blog and will plan to create automation to all social media to the growth of Curly Bytes so i can spend more quality with quantity time to my family, do some hobbies such playing guitar, and even read more on the Books related to Psychology, Life hacks and Investments.

## The Setup 
Im using Codeigniter 3 as for my static website(yes you read it right CI3, legacy php framework old but gold) and convert it to static website(i will create a blog post series on how to modernize existing legacy framework), purchase a domain at [NameCheap][3], the name speaks itself and infra is using Azure with a monthly of $1 per month and this is already a secured one!
